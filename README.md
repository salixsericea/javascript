# javascript

OCRandML5Demo and blur.js is a project with a "plain javascript" canvas. What it does:

1. Turn some text into an image
2. Manually or automatically draw lines, rectancgles, and cats on the image.
3. Cats are created using SkectRNN in ML5.
4. "Tear" the image into two, save as files, combine them later.
5. Allows import of an image file (photo or anything).

But why?????

Just because.

To learn.

To have the computer draw cat doodles all by itself. 

It could be better code. I am, however, happy with the cat doodling because I managed to
use a Promise instead of callback recursion.
